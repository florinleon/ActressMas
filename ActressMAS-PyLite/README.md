# ActressMas PyLite

**ActressMas PyLite** is a lightweight Python multi-agent framework inspired by the original **ActressMas** (.NET) project.

PyLite focuses on the core programming model, i.e., agents that communicate by message passing inside a simulation environment, with a small codebase that is easy to adapt for teaching and experimentation. Unlike the full ActressMas framework, ActressMas PyLite does not offer support for parallel and distributed agent execution.

## Key ideas

- Agents with explicit message passing
- An environment that hosts agents and coordinates simulation steps
- An API that is easy to understand and use
- A set of examples that illustrate multi-agent interaction patterns and algorithms
